# split string on the hidden characters that indicate new lines
data = data.splitlines()

# could also use the following:
# data.split('\n')

# Split each item in this list on the commas; the bracketed expression is a list comprehension. Converts the 'data' list to a list of lists (each row or region becomes a list instead of a string)
data = [i.split(',') for i in data]

# A list comprehension is a way of iterating through the values of a list. You can use a list comprehension to print values or transform the values. In this case, the string first gets split into a list of strings (each row is a string). We then use a list comprehension to take each string and split that into a list so that we end up with a list of lists. For more on list comprehensions, see this blog post (http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python) or checkout the CodeAcademy tutorial on list comprehensions (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-KAgt5/1/1).
